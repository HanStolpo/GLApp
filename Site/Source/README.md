This directory is the source for the static site generated by Hakyll for the GLApp repository. We can use it as a place to
write posts and make slides for our computer graphics user group.

The site builder is a Haskell program that uses Hakyll. The idea is to make it easy to generate content using pandoc 
markdown which gets converted to either HTML slides, blog posts or just general pages.
